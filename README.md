We will assume the learners will have some familiarity with Infrastructure as code and CICD concepts. If you happen to want to review these concepts, you are free to watch the following two video courses at Plurasight:

- [Continuous Delivery and DevOps with Azure DevOps: The Big Picture by Marcel de Vries](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/continuous-delivery-azure-devops-big-picture/table-of-contents)
